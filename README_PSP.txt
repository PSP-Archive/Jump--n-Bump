This is the PSP port of Jump 'n Bump 1.51
Version: b (Slim+Light / non-1.50 Kernel Update)

[PSP Controls]

Use the following Buttons on the PSP to have a 2-Player match:

Analog/D-Pad Left : P1 Left
Analog/D-Pad Right: P1 Right
Analog/D-Pad Up   : P1 Jump

Square            : P2 Left
Circle            : P2 Right
Triangle          : P2 Jump

The following Key Combinations enable special Cheat Modes:

START + D-Pad Up   : Pogostick (continuously jumping bunnies)
START + D-Pad Right: Bunnies in Space (Bunnies can jump higher)
START + D-Pad Down : Jetpack
START + D-Pad Left : Lord of the Flies (Flies are following the Bunnies)
START + LTrigger   : Blood is thicker than water

For the PSP it is not bad to enable the Pogostick mode, so only 2 Buttons are
necessary to be used by both players.
